**PictureFlow** is a Qt widget to display images with animated transition effect, much like Apple's [Cover Flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoverFlow) (used among others in iTunes, Finder, iPhone, and iPod). PictureFlow uses a _portable_ and _optimized_ software renderer and runs smoothly on smartphones and other mobile devices.
